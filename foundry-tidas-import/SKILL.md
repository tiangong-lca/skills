# TianGong Foundry

Use this as the ordinary Foundry entry for both packaged imports and source-evidence development. Foundry owns conversion, context preparation, task state, validation, authorization, execution and recovery. The skill selects inputs, authors evidence-backed decisions, and follows the current public task result.

## Select the task and runtime

Use the qualified managed Foundry runtime selected by the distributed release lock. Keep the writable user workspace separate from the installed skill/runtime. Do not discover a sibling checkout, build a runtime from source, select a floating package or derive a trust anchor from workspace files.

Read [the public task workflow](references/task-workflow.md) to initialize a workspace, start a task or resume one. Keep the user's original request, actor, intended account and input selection. For an existing task, inspect its status before taking another action; do not start a replacement task to escape a blocker or an uncertain write.

- **Packaged import:** select the original supported archive or dataset directory. Let Foundry invoke its qualified native converter and retain conversion reports and dependency evidence.
- **Source evidence:** obtain the relevant source text/tables and traceable citations, then supply candidate TIDAS seed rows alongside that evidence. Use available document or research skills where needed; record the resolved source and artifact provenance. The seed must be one of the selected sources. Retrieved text or candidate rows alone do not prove readiness to write.

## Continue from the current result

Read `status`, `blockers`, `permissions`, `artifacts` and ordered `next_actions` together. A command action supplies the exact executable, argv, working directory and binding. Preserve those fields; use argv-based execution without a shell. A human action describes the particular missing input or decision. Do not reconstruct internal commands from old reports or scan a task directory for something executable.

When a concrete semantic work item is current, load `$foundry-tidas-authoring` if available and pass its complete package and context. If that internal skill is unavailable, use the work item's supplied instructions and template; do not invent a dependency on a sibling skill directory. Preserve identity, classification and location decisions as their own decision types. Retain source-language information and evidence-backed English for required fields. Unresolved mandatory scientific information remains a blocker.

Submit decision or patch files through the current `--semantic-input` contract described in the reference. Foundry validates their evidence, context and hashes, applies them deterministically, and reassesses the resulting rows. Do not edit registered source/final rows, reports or task indexes to make a gate pass.

## Authorization, recovery and completion

Runtime installation, login and semantic acceptance do not authorize a database write. Reuse an existing valid approval within its exact scope. When the runtime reports missing authority, present the concrete current task, destination, dataset scope and requested actions for approval; select only the corresponding current authorization artifact. Never fabricate a grant or broaden one through a new request or revision.

If authentication is required, follow the trusted CLI/host's browser-login action and verify the intended account through its redacted status/doctor evidence. Do not read session contents, collect credentials or change the registered destination implicitly.

After an interrupted or uncertain write, continue the original task's returned readback/recovery action. Do not retry the mutation directly, clear attempt records or create a new workspace to reset it. Keep completed scopes and their original evidence while dependent scopes continue.

Report completion only when the current public task reports `completed` and its retained completion/readback evidence covers the requested scope. Local validation, an empty work queue, a child exit code or a successful upload alone is insufficient. Otherwise report the exact remaining blocker and next action, with the task ID and evidence paths needed to continue.
