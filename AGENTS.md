# AGENTS

## General
- Use concise, precise, unambiguous English only.
- Keep all guidance caller-focused and practical.
- Document only remote invocation methods.

## Authentication
- Always require `Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>` in examples and instructions.
- Define `TOKEN` as either an OAuth JWT or a user key generated by the system (derived from email + password).

## Invocation examples
- Use only the production endpoint: `https://qgzvkongdjqiiamzbbts.supabase.co/functions/v1/<function>`.
- Include required headers only: `Authorization` and any function-specific headers (e.g., `x-region: us-east-1`).

## Prompts
- Describe prompt requirements, not internal schemas.
- State that inputs can be any language or mixed languages.
- Require preservation of all relevant constraints and forbid invented facts.
- Keep outputs retrieval-oriented, neutral, and concise.

## Content scope
- Avoid local serve/invoke instructions or scripts.
- Avoid internal runtime/env details that callers do not need.
